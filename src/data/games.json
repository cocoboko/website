    "description": "Agent is a narrative-driven micro-simulation where you play as the last human check-in agent at a small international airport. As automation takes over, you’ll navigate quirky requests, shifting policies, and the quiet tension of a world moving on without you while making connections like no machine could ever make.",

      "alt": "A pencil sketch of a busy airport terminal features a prominent yellow overhead sign reading “Agent” in bold black letters. The sign shows a stylized figure holding a ticket in front of a kiosk. In the background, soft blue and grey tones illustrate the sweeping glass architecture and a crowd of travelers in motion, with one person in the foreground pulling a suitcase. The vibrant sign stands out against the calm, flowing atmosphere of the terminal. Derived from a photo by Larissa Gies on Unsplash.",
