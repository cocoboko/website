We're thrilled to announce that development has officially begun on Kiosk, our cozy management game that puts you in charge of running an airport kiosk. As we dive into this exciting project, we wanted to share some of our initial plans and what you can expect from future updates.

## Our Vision

Kiosk is more than just a management game â€“ it's a celebration of human connection in an increasingly automated world. As players take on the role of running one of the last human-operated airport kiosks, they'll:

- Build meaningful relationships with regular customers
- Create a welcoming space in the busy airport environment
- Make strategic business decisions while maintaining the human touch
- Learn about different cultures through interactions with international travelers

## What's Next

In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing more details about:

- Core gameplay mechanics
- Character interaction systems
- Shop customization features
- The economic simulation behind the scenes

Stay tuned for regular devlog updates as we progress through development. We're excited to bring you along on this journey!
