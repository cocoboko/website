Short intro

## Goal: Administration and Gameplay

For the second iteration, the adminstrative and marketing foundational tasks continue to reveal themselves and need to be addressed. Still, I _want_ to go and mess around with the codebase I started a while back and try to add one of the key game mechanics for the game to see if it works as well in the game as it does in my mind.

## Where we started?

Before we discuss what got, done. Let's talk about where it started:

![Screenshot of a GitHub Projects Kanban board titled ‘Agent – Playable Slice’ in the Current iteration view. It shows a Backlog column with a red ‘6 / 3’ capacity indicator (four cards: ‘Introduce Agent in a blog post,’ ‘Setup Bing Webmaster Tools,’ ‘Setup Google Search Console,’ and ‘Send incorporation information’) and an In Progress column with a yellow ‘1 / 3’ indicator (one card: ‘Write a script for a passenger using the story circle’). A yellow arrow highlights the ‘6 / 3’ backlog count.](iteration_2_where-it-started.png).

You'll notice the red indicator for the backlog column highlighting that I have too many issues in the backlog. Even through this week is a shorter-ish day-job week for me (i.e. hypothetically more free time), I'm hoping I can push through a bunch of these extra small tasks related to developing something in the open and getting the company registered formally.

## What got done?

## What didn't get done?

Two things:

- A blog post, which is a marketing thing
- A character script, which is a game content thing

The blog post isn't the end of the world. I'm working through learning how to develop in the open while keeping my eye on the development of the game itself.

The character script is pretty important though. I still need to write down the ideas, which have been ruminating throughout the week, but I think it isn't too much to add to the next iteration.

## What was discovered?

What I discovered, and ultimately what I learned, is that there will not be a "perfect plan". 

I know this from years of software development and enterprise implementation project from my day-job. Plus, this is my first stab at a real commercial game, and I don't really know what I'm doing. 

What _I do know_, however, are my constraints. Specifically time and lack of ability with things like art and music. Still, the plan I have is enough to keep focus and it has also been enough to remind me that as I go, I will discover things that I _want_ to implement, but do not _need_ to implement at this point in the project.

## What is the plan for the next iteration?

The next one is going to be a little more development focused, with a pinch more marketing.

There are administrative tasks that are going to pop up that I'm going to need to deal with, beyond just this game, but they are just as important—if not more so—than the rest of the tasks and features in front of me.

See you next week.
