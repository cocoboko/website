Creating a custom game engine is no small feat, but it's a challenge we've embraced at Cocoboko Studios. In this technical deep-dive, we'll explore why we chose to build our own engine and how it's shaping our games.

## Why Build a Custom Engine?

While there are many excellent game engines available, our specific needs led us to develop our own:

- Complete control over performance optimization
- Custom workflow tools for our team
- Specialized features for our unique game mechanics

## Core Features

Our engine focuses on several key areas:

1. **Advanced Physics System**
   - Custom particle simulation
   - Efficient collision detection
   - Real-time fluid dynamics

2. **Rendering Pipeline**
   - Dynamic lighting system
   - Custom shader framework
   - Optimized asset streaming

3. **Audio Framework**
   - Procedural audio generation
   - Dynamic mixing system
   - Spatial audio processing

## Looking Forward

As we continue to develop our engine, we're excited about:

- Implementing machine learning for NPC behaviors
- Expanding our tools for procedural generation
- Optimizing for next-gen hardware capabilities

Stay tuned for more technical insights into our development process!
