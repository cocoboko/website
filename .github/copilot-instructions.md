This is a statically generated, open source website for Cocoboko Studios.

We use Astro as the framework, with React and TailwindCSS integrations installed. Astro components and layouts should be named with PascalCase, while Astro pages and other items should be named using kebab case (e.g. index.astro, social-links.json).

When custom code or script is needed, TypeScript should be used over JavaScript whenever possible.
